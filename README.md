Diffbot Client
==============

1. gem 'diffbot_client'


2. bundle install


3. DiffbotClient::Article.new.get({:token => <your developer token here>,:url => 'http://blog.diffbot.com/diffbots-new-product-api-teaches-robots-to-shop'})


In this Example I had hardcoded my developer token, which I am going to change in the next update.
